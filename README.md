Hey, I'm Richard! I’m a software engineer with a background in e-commerce and health care. I click buttons with React and JavaScript to build products that solve problems. 

Besides gazing at my aesthetic code in admiration, I enjoy storm chasing on sailboats, cooking gastronomic delights, and basking under the sun at bucolic parks. Let's connect! ✌️
