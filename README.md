Hey, I'm Richard! 

I’m a software engineer with experiences in entrepreneurship, military leadership, and heathcare. I click buttons, building products that solve problems. 

Besides gazing at my aesthetic code in admiration, I enjoy storm chasing on sailboats, cooking gastronomic delights, and basking under the sun at bucolic parks. Let's connect! ✌️
