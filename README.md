Hey, I'm Richard!

I'm a software engineer with experiences in NLP, healthcare, military, and e-commerce. 

I enjoy solving problems. When I could not access ChatGPT because it was too busy serving a zillion users, I created my own ChatGPT! Check it out here--> [https://chatgptmessenger-steel.vercel.app/](https://chatgpt-messenger-topaz.vercel.app/)

Besides gazing at my aesthetic code in admiration, I enjoy teaching people how to sail, cooking gastronomic delights and basking under the sun at bucolic parks. 

Thanks for stopping by!
