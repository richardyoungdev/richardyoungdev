Hey, I'm Richard! 

I’m a software engineer with experiences in entrepreneurship, military leadership, and healthcare. I click buttons, building products that solve problems. 

Besides gazing at my aesthetic code in admiration, I enjoy teaching people how to sail, cooking gastronomic delights and basking under the sun at bucolic parks. Let's connect! ✌️
