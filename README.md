Hey, Iâ€™m Richard! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m a software engineer. Iâ€™m super excited to compliment my entrepreneurial, military leadership, and management consulting experience with software development.

I build products to help people live happier lives.

In my free time, I love to teach sailing, cook gastronomic delights, and play beach volleyball!
