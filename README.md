Hey, I'm Richard!

I'm a software engineer with experiences in NLP, healthcare, and the military. 

Besides gazing at my aesthetic code in admiration, I enjoy teaching people how to sail, cooking gastronomic delights and basking under the sun at bucolic parks. 

Here's a cool project I made: https://chatgptmessenger-steel.vercel.app/ 

Thanks for stopping by!
